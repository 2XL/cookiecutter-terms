# cookiecutter-terms
cookiecutter terms and conditions

### Motivation

this is a side project to learn pdf generation and interactive site content translations

### Feature 
    
    Generate Markdown 
    
    Generate React component
    
    Generate PDF
    
    Generate Translations

### Dependencies


- react-markdown: for markdown rendering
- react-pdf: for pdf generation
- TODO: react-intl: for translations


### Getting Started with React


`/app` contains the boilerplate of a base react app, it was generated with:

```bash

npm init react-app app


Success! Created app at ./app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd app
  npm start

Happy hacking!

```
